## Getting Started

(Placeholder - Link to game)

Begin by selecting a difficulty, then press the _Start_ button. The difficulty selected will determine your starting hitpoints and strength. Press the _Roll_ button to attack the monster. Rolling returns a number between 1 and 8, which is added to your strength to determine the damage you deal. Good luck!

## Next Steps
- Give the player a set of starting items depending on the difficulty selected
- Let the player roll for initiative at the start of each round. If the player rolls higher than the monster, the player gets to attack first
- Give monsters a chance to drop items
- Instead of only encountering monsters, add in additional encounters (e.g. treasure rooms or rest areas). Add an element of risk-reward by giving the player two options: to roll or to leave. The player can leave with no penalty and move on to the next encounter. If the player chooses to roll, they must roll above a certain value in order to avoid a negative outcome (e.g. a trap or an ambush).
